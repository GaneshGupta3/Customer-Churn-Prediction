# üß† ANN-Based Customer Churn Predictor

[![Streamlit App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-Open%20App-brightgreen?logo=streamlit)](https://ann-churn-predictor.streamlit.app/)

A responsive and easy-to-use **Streamlit web application** that predicts the likelihood of a customer leaving a bank using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with **TensorFlow**. This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be deployed for real-world decision-making in customer retention strategies.

## üï∏Ô∏è Model Architecture

The **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** used for churn prediction consists of:

- **Input Layer**: Receives 11 features after encoding and scaling.
- **Hidden Layer 1**: Dense layer with ReLU activation.
- **Hidden Layer 2**: Dense layer with ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer**: Dense layer with a sigmoid activation to output churn probability between 0 and 1.

> üîß The model was trained using the **binary cross-entropy** loss function and the **Adam optimizer**.

## üîç What is Customer Churn?

**Customer churn** refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a company‚Äôs service during a certain time frame. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive steps to retain high-risk customers and improve satisfaction.
